# TheBakery
The Bakery is an open source 2d game written in Java. The goal of the game is to be a business simulator set in a bakery. The ultimately goal is to provide very realistic business simulation mechanics and include many features such as viewing competitors setting prices and even taking a loss for a short time in order to put competitors out of business. However, that is not very likely to happy unless other people help. The creator currently doesn't have enough time to active work on this project at a pace that will make it be completed in any reasonable amount of time. The current game is very limited and doesn't have much actual game-play at all.

Feel free to download the game source code and aid in development if you're up for it.
